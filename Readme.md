# Lab 13 - Array Smallest

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to give you practice reading arrays and finding the smallest value.

## Instructions
* Complete the method `getSmallest` so it will return the smallest value in the array passed.
* You may edit the `main` method to add additional situations for you to test.
* Complete all javadoc comment with the proper tags.

## Relevant ThinkJava Section
* [Arrays](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6009.html)

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.

## Grading
* 90 - `getSmallest` works correctly
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
